## Description

### Human Prostate Cancer, Adjacent Normal Section with IF Staining (FFPE)

10x Genomics obtained FFPE human prostate tissue from Indivumed Human Tissue Specimens. Original diagnosis with adenocarcinoma. The tissue was sectioned as described in Visium Spatial Gene Expression for FFPE – Tissue Preparation Guide Demonstrated Protocol (CG000408). Tissue sections of 10 µm were placed on Visium Gene Expression slides, then stained following Deparaffinization, Decrosslinking, Immunofluorescence Staining & Imaging Demonstrated Protocol (CG000410).

### Single-cell Transcriptome Atlas of Testis Aging

Unhealthy aging of testis seriously affects fertility and life quality of older men, while its interventions depend on in-depth knowledge of the molecular and functional changes of various testicular cell types. Here, we profile human testicular single-cell transcriptomes from young adult, healthy old men and late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) patients, and identified the somatic cells underwent a greater change than germ cells.
